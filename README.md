# sign-up-form

The purpose of this project is to create a basic sign up form for a make believe product/service.

The sign up page will use html and CSS styling to create a basic form to accept user info such as below.
First Name
Last Name
Email
Phone Number
Password
Confirm Password

There will be a create account button that will trigger validations on each of the entry fields to make sure they have valid data.

This project will not include any JavaScript so the form will not actually do anyting. It will simplay be HTML and CSS Styling.
